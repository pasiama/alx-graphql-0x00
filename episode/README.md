## Queries

We used the `episode(id: ID!)` field to fetch data. Each query retrieves the following fields:

- `episode-id-1-output.json`: JSON response for episode ID 1
- `episode-id-2.graphql`: Query for episode ID 2
- `episode-id-2-output.json`: JSON response for episode ID 2
- `episode-id-3.graphql`: Query for episode ID 3
- `episode-id-3-output.json`: JSON response for episode ID 3
- `episode-id-4.graphql`: Query for episode ID 4
- `episode-id-4-output.json`: JSON response for episode ID 4

## How to Use

1. Run the GraphQL queries using a GraphQL client or API testing tool.
2. Save the responses as `.json` files.
3. Place the files in the specified directory structure.
